            <p>Greetings! I hope you'll join me on my journey to becoming a Sofware Engineer. But first, to get things started, let me tell you a little bit about myself. 
                <br>My name is Kelsey (she/her) from Chicago, IL. For the past 7.5 years I have worked in the test development industry editing multiple-choice questions and developing examinations for to-be physicians to test their readiness. It was a challenging and rewarding field to work in, but it came time to move on and try something new. After a great deal of self-discovery I found that I really enjoyed the challenge of coding and learning how to build programs and websites from scratch -- so here I am!
                <br><br>When I'm not studying or writing you can find me at wine and cheese nights with friends, serving as a bed for my cat Oliver, or rock climbing. Early this past summer I took a trip with friends to the Holy Boulders in Southern Illinois and did some of my first real climbing outside. Below is a picture of a project I spent quite a bit of time working on before finally sending it right before heading out on the last day of the trip.
